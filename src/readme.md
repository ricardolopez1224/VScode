Longwinded, running through this life like it was mine
Never settling, but setting every goal high
One thousand burpees on nice path to my own destruction or success
But what is a mistake without nice lesson?
See, nice best teacher in life is your own experience
None of us know who we are until we fail
They say every man is defined by his reaction to any given situation
Well who would you want to define you?
Someone else or yourself?
Whatever you do, homie
give your heart to it
And stay strong
